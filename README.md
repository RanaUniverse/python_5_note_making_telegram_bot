# Note Making App inside telegram bot

    🙋 Thanks I am Just Practise This 🍌


## The Commands Bot is Now Able to use

1. `/start`- This will show little welcome to user.

2. `/help`- This is just for see some command bot can now have to use.  

* **Below is still in Development making state**.

3. `/register` - i will use this where user can register them.

4. `/my_note` - See all my note to user

5. `/new_note` - it will start conversaion handler where user can save their note.

6. `/edit_note` - Edit your note but how i dont make it till now

7. `/transfer_note` - This will transfer note ownership to others

8. `/delete_note` - Delete a note that you have won.


### Below things i made past but will delete as i made those for testing




1. [`/add_me_to_database_cmd`](files/practise_file/adding_users_module.py) - I will remove this as this will replace by register

2. [`/new_note_without_title`](files/practise_file/new_note_module.py) - This did a sample example of insert data in the bot I made it for just testing, which will not need; now it will be /new_note

3. [`note_information_by_note_id`](files/practise_file/new_note_module.py) - This function retrieves note details using the note ID and was part of my testing; it will be removed as it's no longer needed.





## Below is Old Readme File 👇👇👇

I will make some notes and keep store and edite and do a lot of things with interection with bots.

1. i will have some command to interect with bot about set up somethign.

1st Commit: i have just make my bot responsive without any database design, i think to make some command to add user and like these thigns in after some commit.



## Problem now:

i have made tables in the models.py file

i dont understand what i will do so that note 's table user id which is connected with user table how this not shows error that user talbe's user id is not present but in the note row the value is availabel to commit and save in the database.
